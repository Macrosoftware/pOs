# pOs
pOs are Pawel-Sub-Operating System.

You can download it, sell it, but you can't say you are author of it.
If someone ask you, who is author, you must say: "Pawel3_linux on github is author.".

This is console sub-OS. sub-OS means, this isn't really OS.
It boots on other OS (for example Linux).
